            Consider the flow of information through the task flow when writing your orchestration instruction: **if the final task depends on the output of an earlier task, you must include the task_id of the task it depends on in the "use_output_from" field**.
            Your team members can complete tasks iteratively, Agents can handle multiple similar tasks in one instruction.
            For example, if you want a travel agent to find flights and a spreadsheet agent to create a spreadsheet with the flight options, you *MUST* include the task_id of the travel related task in the "use_output_from" field of the spreadsheet agent's task.
            For example, if you want an agent to extract data from a webpage, you should tell it exactly what data to extract, and that its final response should be a comprehensive summary of the data extracted with in-text URL citations.
            Your instruction should be extensive, exhaustive, and well engineered prompt instruction for the agent. Don't just issue a simple instruction string; tell it what to do and achieve, and what its final response should be.

            Available Agents (to be used as agent_id in the multi_agent_flow instruction):
            {available_agents}

            This tool should be used BEFORE delegating tasks to create a comprehensive plan. It helps structure and organize how tasks should flow between agents.
            The tool will analyze the tasks and dependencies to create an optimal execution plan, considering:
            - What information each task needs
            - Which tasks depend on outputs from other tasks
            - How to sequence the tasks efficiently
            - What specific instructions each agent needs

            The plan can then be used to guide the actual task delegation and execution.

            Available Agents:
            {available_agents}

            Args:
                goal (str): The goal of the composition.

            Returns:
                str: A detailed execution plan to assist in your orchestration.
